**Hello!** This repository contains the code for the analyses presented in the paper *TITLE* by A Brizzi et al.

## Quick Start

### System Requirements

- UNIX or MacOs, the code was developed on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
- [R](https://www.r-project.org/) version `â‰¥4.1.2`.
- [cmdstan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/cmdstan) version `2.27.0`.

We additionally [conda]() or [miniconda]() to reproduce our package environment.

### Installation

You can follow the steps below to clone our codebase locally and rerun the analyses. 

1. Clone the github repository in a directory of your choice.
2. Install the dependencies by running `sh dependencies_cmdstan.sh`.
3. Download the data necessary to run the analyses from TODO.
4. Specify the path to downloaded data directory in `R/paths.R` at line 22: \
    `indir.zenodo <- "PATH-TO-DOWNLOADED-ZENODO-DATA"`
 
>  **Note** A common error with new installations of `cmdstanr` is the inability to compile stan files due to a `need to set TBB_CXX_TYPE` (see [here](https://bytemeta.vip/repo/stan-dev/cmdstanpy/issues/374?page=1) for a solution).

### Reproducing our Analyses

You are now in the position to run our code, reproduce our analyses, or explore new possibilities.
We suggest to save the results of your runs in the `results` subdirectory of our zenodo repository.
As such, we suggest to define the following environment variable on the command line:

```{sh}
ZENODO_DIR="PATH-TO-DOWNLOADED-ZENODO-DATA"
```

To run the code with the same settings as in our paper, we then run from the root directory of the repository the `run_stan` executable.

```{sh}
./run_stan OUTDIR="$ZENODO_DIR/results" ROUND=19 MODELS="run-gp-prevl" LOCAL=TRUE
```

Note that alternative output directories can be used, and the above can also be run as a bash script through `bash run_stan ...`.
Once all jobs are run, it is possible to run our postprocessing code, involving reproducibility of figures, tables and an `html` report summarising the runs.

```{sh}
./run_postprocessing OUTDIR="$ZENODO_DIR/results" LOCAL=TRUE
```

> **Note on flags.** The two executables `run_stan` and `run_postprocessing` take a number of flags whose documentation can be read through the `-h` flag (eg: `./run_stan -h`). The most important are:
> * `OUTDIR`: indicates the directory where we want to save the results of our runs.
> * `LOCAL`: indicates we want to run jobs locally, instead of submitting them to a job scheduler with `qsub`.
> * `MODELS` indicates which models we want to run, and can be one, or a combination of, the following: `run-gp-prevl`, `run-gp-supp-pop`, `run-gp-supp-hiv`.
> * `ROUND` flag indicates the survey round for which we want to run our analyses 
> 
> Every flag should be specified as `FLAG=value` or `FLAG="value with spaces"`, leaving no white spaces before and after the `=` sign.
