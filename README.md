## Quick Start

### System Requirements

- UNIX or MacOs, the code was developed on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
- [R](https://www.r-project.org/) version `â‰¥4.1.2`.
- [cmdstan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/cmdstan) version TODO....

We additionally [conda]() or [miniconda]() to reproduce our package environment.

### Installation

You can follow the steps below to clone our codebase locally and rerun the analyses. 

1. Clone the github repository in a directory of your choice.
2. Install the dependencies by running `sh dependencies_cmdstan.sh`.
 
> ** Note ** A common error with new installations of `cmdstanr` is the inability to compile stan files due to a `need to set TBB_CXX_TYPE` (see [here](https://bytemeta.vip/repo/stan-dev/cmdstanpy/issues/374?page=1) for a solution).

### Reproducing our Analyses

You are now in the position to run our code, reproduce our analyses, or explore new possibilities.
To run the code with the same settings as in our paper, run from the root directory of the repository:

```{sh}
# Run ./run_stan -h for more help on the available flags
./run_stan OUTDIR="path/to/desired/output/directory"
```

[ MAYBE ADD FLAGS `ROUND` `MODEL` AND `LOCAL` TO NOT RUN TOO MANY THINGS AT ONCE??? ]
The above prepares a different bash job for every combination of the three prevalence measures of interest and each of the four survey rounds. The resulting `.pbs` files are saved in the `OUTDIR` and can be either submitted through a `PBS` job scheduler, or they can be run as bash scripts individually.
Note that running the script redirects you to the specified `OUTDIR`.

Once all jobs are run, it is possible to run our postprocessing code, involving reproducibility of figures, tables and an `html` report summarising the runs.

```{sh}
# Run ./run_postprocessing -h for more help on the available flags
./run_postprocessing OUTDIR="path/to/desired/output/directory"
```
