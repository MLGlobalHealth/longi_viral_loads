# THRESHOLDs

Compare results for thresholds given by: 1000 copies/mL; 50 copies/mL 

# SAMPLE SIZEs

histogram showing for which rounds the >= 3 groups has NO MEASUREMENTs?
is the problem that we are still waiting for data?
(sampe for group >= 2)


# Posterior predictive check:
From AkiVethari's [github](https://avehtari.github.io/modelselection/)

- Simulate new datasets with posterior distribution and then check whether our data is consistent with that.
- (Need a way to visualise then)
- Same but with ancillary statistics. (ancillary meaning independent of model?)
- Can be used to have a posterior predictive p-value. (ppp-value) 
- but usully just better to compare against distribution.

we are using double use of data, so risks of p-value to not be calibrated. For that consider CV.
(is there an easy way to perform CV in STAN?)
